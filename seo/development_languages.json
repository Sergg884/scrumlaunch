The props of a component are received by the component above them, that is, the parent component and are immutable. Some components may have default props and they exist even if the parent component does not pass down props. Props and State are similar but their usage is different. The majority of components are usually Stateless. However, props are used to pass information or data from the parent to the child.

That leads to unnecessary coupling of concrete implementation in your code instead of working with an interface abstraction. Another malicious side effect of “convenient” singletons is the global state. Often singletons enable global state sharing and play the role of a “public bag” that every object uses to store state.
