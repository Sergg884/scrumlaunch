When you have only one instance of something, it’s very tempting to reference and use it everywhere directly instead of injecting it into your objects. That leads to unnecessary coupling of concrete implementation in your code instead of working with an interface abstraction. Another malicious side effect of “convenient” singletons is the global state. Often singletons enable global state sharing and play the role of a “public bag” that every object uses to store state.
